# Python Data Structures Repository

This folder contains Python Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating core **data structures** concepts, with examples and practice exercises.  
It is designed for beginners to intermediate learners to understand how to use Python for real-world data storage and manipulation.

## Contents

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `List.ipynb` | Covers Python lists, list methods, loops, and list comprehensions. |
| `Tuple.ipynb` | Covers tuples, tuple unpacking, immutability, and common tuple operations. |
| `Set.ipynb` | Covers sets, set operations (union, intersection, difference), and uniqueness property. |
| `Dictionary.ipynb` | Covers dictionaries, key-value pairs, nested dictionaries, loops, and dictionary methods. |
| `Sequence_Data_structure.ipynb` | Covers sequence data structures such as strings, lists, and tuples with examples. |
| `Stack.ipynb` | Demonstrates stack implementation using Python lists, push/pop/peek operations, and LIFO concept. |
| `Queue.ipynb` | Demonstrates queue implementation using `deque`, enqueue/dequeue operations, and FIFO concept. |
| `Data_structure.ipynb` | General notebook summarizing all data structures with examples and exercises. |

## Learning Goals

- Understand the difference between **mutable and immutable** data structures.  
- Practice using Python built-in **data structures** efficiently.  
- Learn **sequence(List, Tuple) vs non-sequence(Set, Dictionary)** data structures.  
- Implement **stack and queue** operations.  
- Solve basic **data structure problems** using Python.

---

## How to Use

1. Open each `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or VSCode.  
2. Follow the explanations and run the code cells.  
3. Try modifying examples or solving the exercises to strengthen understanding.  
4. Use this folder as a reference for Python data structure interviews and projects.

## Recommended Commit Strategy

- Commit each notebook **individually**.  
- Include **short descriptive commit messages** like:
  - `Add List.ipynb with basic and advanced examples`
  - `Add Tuple.ipynb with unpacking and slicing`
  - `Add Stack.ipynb with push/pop operations`
