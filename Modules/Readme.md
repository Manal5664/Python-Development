# Python Modules Practice: Built-in and User-Defined

This repository contains **practice files** created to understand how **Python modules** work.  
It focuses on using **built-in modules** and creating/importing **user-defined modules** in a simple and clear manner.

---

## Contents Overview

The repository includes **three Python files**:
- One file demonstrating the usage of **Python built-in modules**
- A `user_defined` folder containing **two Python files**:
  - One file acting as a user-defined module
  - One file importing and using that module

The files are intended for **learning and practice purposes only**.

---

## Concepts Practiced

- Python built-in modules
- User-defined modules
- Import statements
- Using modules across files and folders
- Execution control with `__name__ == "__main__"`

---

## Execution Control

The `__name__ == "__main__"` condition is used to ensure that code executes only when a file is run directly and not when it is imported into another file.

---

## Purpose

These files were written to:
- Practice Python modular programming
- Understand how imports work in Python
- Learn clean separation between module logic and execution
