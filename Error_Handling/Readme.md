# Python Try-Except Practice

This repository contains simple Python programs demonstrating the use of **try–except** for exception handling. Each task focuses on handling common runtime errors in an easy and beginner-friendly way.

## Tasks Completed

1. **String to Integer Conversion**  
   Handles invalid user input while converting a string into an integer.

2. **Division of Two Numbers**  
   Performs division and handles the **ZeroDivisionError**.

3. **File Handling**  
   Opens a file and handles the case when the file does not exist.

4. **List Index Access**  
   Accesses an element from a list and handles the **IndexError**.

5. **Dictionary Key Access**  
   Accesses a value from a dictionary and handles the **KeyError**.

6. **Multiple Exception Handling**  
   Handles multiple exceptions such as **ValueError** and **ZeroDivisionError**.

7. **try–except–else Usage**  
   Demonstrates input validation using the `else` block.

8. **finally Block**  
   Shows how the `finally` block executes regardless of exceptions.

9. **General Exception Handling**  
   Uses the `Exception` class to catch and display general errors.

10. **Mathematical Error Handling**  
    Handles errors during mathematical operations (e.g., square root of a negative number).

## Purpose

The purpose of these programs is to:
- Understand how exceptions occur in Python  
- Learn proper error handling using `try–except`  
- Prevent program crashes  

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

Run any Python file using:

```bash
python filename.py
