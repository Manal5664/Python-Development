# Python Loop Practice

## Overview
This repository contains my practice work on Python loops. The main objective is to build a strong foundation in iteration and control flow by applying loops to different data structures and scenarios.

All programs are written for learning purposes with a focus on clarity and logical understanding.

---

## Concepts Practiced

### For Loop
- Iterating over sequences
- Using `range()` for controlled iterations
- Applying conditions inside loops

### While Loop
- Condition-based looping
- Use of `break` and `continue`
- Preventing infinite loops

### List Loop
- Iterating through list elements
- Performing operations on list values
- Understanding index-based and direct iteration

### Tuple Loop
- Looping through immutable data structures
- Reading and processing tuple values

### Dictionary Loop
- Iterating over keys
- Iterating over values
- Iterating over key-value pairs using `.items()`

---

## Misc File (Nested Loops)

The `misc` file contains practice related to nested loops:

### Nested Loop with List
- Iterating through nested lists
- Accessing inner list elements
- Understanding multi-level loop execution

### Nested Loop with Dictionary
- Working with dictionaries containing nested data
- Iterating through complex dictionary structures
- Practical data traversal practice

---

## Learning Objectives
- Strengthen understanding of Python loops
- Improve logical thinking and iteration flow
- Prepare for advanced Python topics and problem-solving

## Notes
- This repository is created for practice and learning
- Code is written in a simple and readable manner
- Emphasis is on logic rather than optimization
